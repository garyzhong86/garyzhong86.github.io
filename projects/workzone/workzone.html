<h3>Motivations</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>It is estimated that work zones constitutes 10% of overall congestion, which can be converted to over $700 million value of fuel loss in</li>
 	<li>With data being produced at an unprecedented rate, the use of visual data analytics for our transportation infrastructure is more crucial than ever to synthesize information and reduce cognitive work load a concise and meaningful way</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Objectives</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>To develop a web-based real-time monitoring suite that is able to fuse heterogeneous data source (e.g., remote traffic microwave sensors, Bluetooth sensors, OpenReach traffic incident data etc.)</li>
 	<li>To implement the MAP-21 performance measure via the work zone monitoring effort</li>
 	<li>To visualize the massive amount of heterogeneous data to derive insight for decision-making for NJDOT</li>
 	<li>To provide a platform, along with in-house data infrastructure, that is suitable for expanding the monitoring effort the statewide work zones within NJ in the near future</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Approach</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The Work Zone Interactive Monitoring Application (WIMAP) was initially developed to systematically monitor impact of I-295 Direction Connect reconstruction

 	<li>NJIT research team also deployed RTMS and Bluetooth sensor at carefully-considered and critical position to collect vital traffic data around the work zone. Later in-house Bluetooth sensors, time lapse camera, and portable pneumatic tube

 	<li>WIMAP is designed to fuse heterogeneous data sources (e.g., remote traffic microwave sensors, Bluetooth sensors, OpenReach traffic incident data etc.) and provide users with instantaneous MAP-21 performance measure (e.g. travel time index (TTI), buffer index, planning time index (PTI), and percentile travel time, as well as formatted status reports.

 	<li>Visualization plays a crucial role in WIMAP in informing user with the traffic conditions
