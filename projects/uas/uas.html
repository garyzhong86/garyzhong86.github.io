<h3>Motivation</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Traditional stationary traffic camera provide coverage in limited locations and have a high infrastructure investment cost</li>
 	<li>The ad-hoc deployment of sUAS equipped with appropriate communication systems is capable of transmission video signal in real time in a much more portable way compared to stationary camera</li>
 	<li>Automated fight control for sUAS have been rapidly expanding and adapting the latest flight technologies:
<ul>
 	<li>GPS-based guidance</li>
 	<li>long-range wireless video transmission</li>
 	<li>Automated flight assistance</li>
 	<li>Ultrasonic obstacle avoidance system</li>
 	<li>Return home function in the even of emergency</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has introduced the Part 107 (the Small Unmanned Aircraft Regulations) regulation, streamlining the deployment and testing of sUAS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Objective</h3>
identify and evaluate the feasibility potential benefits of using small UAS for traffic monitoring and incident management
<h3>Approach</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Using commercial-off-the-shelf sUAS (e.g., DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 4, DJI Mavic Pro, GeoBlue Surveyor 800)
[gallery ids="100,92,99,104,98" type="rectangular" link="file"]</li>
 	<li>Retrofitting the sUAS with communication devices that is capable of transmitting data via commercial 4G/LET network.</li>
 	<li>High-level concept of using sUAS for traffic incident management
